## Overview of Changes for CSE 134B HW5 P3

In this update, I focused on improving the structure, maintainability, and user experience of the site. I refactored the HTML and CSS for the work page to use my own styling and layout for better consistency and readability. Changed the font file to use WOFF2 instead of TTF for better performance. The CSS was reorganized for clarity, and unnecessary elements like font preloads and some JS demonstrations from HW4 were removed to enhance performance. I also fixed the web manifest link and moved it to the root directory to align with web standards, ensuring proper PWA functionality. Additionally, I enhanced the contact form error messages to provide clearer feedback to users. These changes were made to improve the overall user experience, follow best practices, and make the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
